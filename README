This is a repository of useful matlab functions and scripts. Typically these
are utility functions that are not stand alone applications. Sometimes they are
even just useful one-liners wrapped into appropriately named functions.

The functions have been organized into folders based on their primary
application:
  dithering/
  geometry/
  imageprocessing/
  images/
  matlabPyrTools/
  matrix/
  mesh/
  meshplot/
  old/
  paths/
  plot/
  utility/

each folder see Documentation.txt)
